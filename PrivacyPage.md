# Privacy Policy (OSS Reference)

The production privacy policy is maintained in `src/pages/Privacy.tsx`. Refer to that component for the authoritative English/Japanese bilingual text tailored for the open-source release.

Key points:

- Authentication and usage data are stored only when an administrator self-hosts the project.
- Generated assets and logs remain under the control of the hosting organization.
- Contact the maintainers through the GitHub Issues page for privacy-related questions.
