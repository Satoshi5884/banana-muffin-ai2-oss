# Terms of Use (OSS Reference)

The latest Terms of Use for Banana-muffin AI OSS are implemented in the React page `src/pages/Terms.tsx`, which provides bilingual English and Japanese content for self-hosted deployments.

Highlights:

- The project is distributed "as is"; administrators must approve accounts before generation features are available.
- Usage credits, storage limits, and access policies are controlled by the self-hosted administrator.
- Legal or support inquiries should be opened via GitHub Issues in the project repository.
